.SH NAME 
.B _printf
- formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \(dqmain.h\(dq

.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a format
and prints it to the standard output, much like the C standard library function printf. It can receive a variable number of arguments.

.B Return value
On success, _printf returns the number of characters printed. If format is NULL or if the functions encounters any errors, it returns -1.

.B Format of the format string
The format string can contain any characters, just like a regular string, in double quotes, which will be printed as is.
However, this format string can contain conversion specifiers. These start with a %, and are followed with a character.

.B Conversion specifiers
These are the characters that specify the type of the variable that needs to be printed. 
The variables to be printed are separated from the format string with a comma. Each variable passed to _printf need to have a conversion specifier.

.B i, d
- Both these specifiers are for int arguments. They convert the variable to a decimal number, positive or negative.
.B c
- Prints a single character.

.B s
- Prints an entire string.
